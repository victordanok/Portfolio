							<h1 class="major">Customer Segmentation using Clustering with RFM - values</h1>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/cusseg.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p><h3>Overview</h3>
								Sprocket Central Pty Ltd needs help with its customer and transactions data. 
								The organisation has a large dataset relating to its customers, but their team is unsure how to effectively analyse it to help optimise its marketing strategy.
								The aim of this is to segment the customers so the company knows which customers to target for marketing
								
								<h3>Data</h3>
								The data was gotten from the KPMG virtual internship on <a href='https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/theme/m7W4GMqeT3bh9Nb2c/KPMG-Data-Analytics-Virtual-Internship'>Forage</a>

							</p>
							<p><h3> Libraries and Packages Used</h3>
								<li>Python</li>
								<li>Numpy Library</li>
								<li>Pandas Library</li>
								<li>Matplotlib Library and Seaborn Library</li>

								<h3>Older Customers</h3>
								Using Recency - R, Frequency - F, Money - M, RFM-value, the customer levels were segmented according to their patronage to the organization, 
								so in the future, the company would know which customers to focus their marketing strategies.
								
								<h3>New Customers</h3>
								Using the same RFM - value, customers were also segmented into the levels of their patronage.
								due to this being a new customers list, there was no Recency score. 
								Hence, their monetary value and their frequency of visits were used to calculate the RFM value and this assisted in grouping the customers into Platinum, Gold, Silver and Bronze Levels.
							</p>
							<p><h3>Clusters</h3>
								Hence, the clusters are:
								<li>Platinum Customers</li>
								<li>Gold Customers</li>
								<li>Silver Customers</li>
								<li>Bronze Customers</li>
