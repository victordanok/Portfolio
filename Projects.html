							<p><i>Skills: python, machine learning, streamlit, supervised learning, data analysis</i></p>
							<p> Here a model was trained to determine clients that should be granted their loan application based on their demographic
							and financial traits. This classification model was trained using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree.
							With Logistic Regression outperforming the rest in its higher precision and accuracy for the model.

							<p>Using an imbalanced dataset gotten from <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud'> Kaggle </a>,
							a model was trained to predict fraudulent credit card transactions, the model was trained using Random Forest as it had the highest
							precision-recall accuracy. The accuracy of the model was measured using the area under the Precision-recall curve(AUPRC).
