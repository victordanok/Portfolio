							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/fraud1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase</p>
							<p><h3>Tools/Packages Used</h3>
								<ul> 
									<li> Python </li>
									<li> Numpy </li>
									<li> Pandas </li>
									<li> Scikit-learn for Machine Learning </li>
									<li> Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualizations </li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<p><h3>Data</h3>
								The data was gotten from <a href= 'https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/download'>Kaggle. </a>
								The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
								This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
								It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. 
								Features V1, V2, â€¦ V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. 
								The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-sensitive learning. 
								Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.
								Given the class imbalance ratio, we recommend measuring the accuracy using the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC). Confusion matrix accuracy is not meaningful for unbalanced classification.
							</p>
							<p><h3>Model Performance</h3>
								<ul> <li> Imbalanced Dataset - From the three models used, random forest has an overall better performance, followed by Support Vector machine and Logistic regression.</li>
									<li>SMOTE oversampling - Random Forest classifier also outperformed Logistic Regression classifier and Support Vector classifier.</li>
							</p>
							<p><h3>API Development</h3>
								Due to the data having undergone transformation with Principal components analysis, there is not enough data to base our application input on
